# Lego-Sequencer
Lego-Sequencer project

# Disclaimer
This project is heavily inspired from  the Monster Lab by SAMTOMINDUSTRYS, see https://github.com/SAMTOMINDUSTRYS/monsterlab . Especially the phenotype table for the sequenced monster was is here in good use.

# Requirements
To build the sequencer, a few items need to be available, respective need to be available:

1. Arduino Uno R3 (https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3)
2. A stepping motor plus controller
3. An RGB sensor (e.g. Adafruit TCS34725)
4. 2x2 Lego bricks in four colours (preferrably red, green, blue and yellow)
5. Something to build the sequencer, I used also Lego for that, but wood, acryl, etc should do as well
6. Installed craiyon API (https://github.com/fischuu/craiyon.py)
7. Installed Arduino IDE

Instead of using an Arduino and stepping motor, I used in this project actually an Elegoo starter kit that contains a compatible microcontroller, stepper and stepper controller. You can find it here https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-uno-most-complete-starter-kit

# Setup

## Building the sequencer and wiring it

On the project page you can find a detailed series of pictures, how the Lego sequencer was build and wired:
